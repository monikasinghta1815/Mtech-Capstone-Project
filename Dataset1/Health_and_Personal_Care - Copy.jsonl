I realize not everyone takes chemistry, but 4 ppl liked his review & so misinformation is spreading.  This works. If however you are on opiate level medications that are causing constipation you should talk to your pain dr or your gastrointestinal dr & ask for a medication called Linzess which works must better & must faster, but is unnecessary for most people.  If magnesium is working for you just make sure to take it with food & drink 6-8 glasses of water per day.  Staying hydrated will really help.  Before switching to Linzess I used to take one 1,000 mg pill am & pm every day with meals & always with an 8 ounce glass of water or other liquid.", "images": [], "asin": "B07TDSJZMR", "parent_asin": "B07TDSJZMR", "user_id": "AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ", "timestamp": 1580950175902, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}
